    "#### What Is A Thread In Computer Science?\n",
    "In software programming, a thread is the smallest unit of execution with the independent set of instructions. It is a part of the process and operates in the same context sharing program’s runnable resources like memory. A thread has a starting point, an execution sequence, and a result. It has an instruction pointer that holds the current state of the thread and controls what executes next in what order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is Multithreading In Computer Science?\n",
    "The ability of a process to execute multiple threads parallelly is called multithreading. Ideally, multithreading can significantly improve the performance of any program. And Python multithreading mechanism is pretty user-friendly which you can learn quickly."

    "### Python Multithreading Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers two modules to implement threads in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. <thread> module and\n",
    "   2. <threading> module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For your information, Python 2.x used to have the <thread> module. But it got deprecated in Python 3.x and renamed to <_thread> module for backward compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal difference between the two modules is that the module <_thread> implements a thread as a function. On the other hand, the module <threading> offers an object-oriented approach to enable thread creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How To Use The Thread Module To Create Threads?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide the <thread> module to apply in your program, then use the following method to spawn threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Syntax\n",
    "thread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is quite efficient and straightforward for creating threads. You can use it to run programs in both Linux and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method starts a new thread and returns its identifier. It’ll invoke the function specified as the “function” parameter with the passed list of arguments. When the <function> returns, the thread would silently exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, args is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call <function> without any arguments. The optional <kwargs> argument specifies the dictionary of keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the <function> terminates with an unhandled exception, a stack trace is printed and then the thread exits (It doesn’t affect other threads, they continue to run). Use the below code to learn more about threading.\n"
